# Advanced Macroeconomics I

This is a collection of files and lecture notes accompanying the first part in the sequence of the Advanced Macroeconomics I  taught at Goethe University Frankfurt. This part is taught by [Marek Ignaszak](https://marekignaszak.github.io/).

In this repo, you'll find the lecture notes, codes, and additional materials that we will use throughout the course.
